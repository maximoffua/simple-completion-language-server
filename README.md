Based on [comment](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/3328#issuecomment-1559031060)

### Install (from source only)

From GitHub:

```console
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/estin/simple-completion-language-server.git
```

From local repository:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/estin/simple-completion-language-server.git
$ cd simple-completion-language-server
$ cargo install --path .
```

### Configure

For Helix on `~/.config/helix/languages.toml`

```toml
# introduce new language server
[language-server.scls]
command = "simple-completion-language-server"

[language-server.scls.config]
max_completion_items = 100           # set max completion results len for each group: words, snippets, unicode-input
feature_words = true                 # enable completion by word
feature_snippets = true              # enable snippets
snippets_first = true                # completions will return before snippets by default
snippets_inline_by_word_tail = false # suggest snippets by WORD tail, for example text `xsq|` become `x^2|` when snippet `sq` has body `^2`
feature_unicode_input = false        # enable "unicode input"
feature_paths = false                # enable path completion
feature_citations = false            # enable citation completion (only on `citation` feature enabled)


# write logs to /tmp/completion.log
[language-server.scls.environment]
RUST_LOG = "info,simple-completion-language-server=info"
LOG_FILE = "/tmp/completion.log"

# append language server to existed languages
[[language]]
name = "rust"
language-servers = [ "scls", "rust-analyzer" ]

[[language]]
name = "git-commit"
language-servers = [ "scls" ]

# etc..

# introduce a new language to enable completion on any doc by forcing set language with :set-language stub
[[language]]
name = "stub"
scope = "text.stub"
file-types = []
shebangs = []
roots = []
auto-format = false
language-servers = [ "scls" ]
```

### Snippets

Read snippets from dir `~/.config/helix/snippets` or specify snippets path via `SNIPPETS_PATH` env.

Default lookup directory can be overriden via `SCLS_CONFIG_SUBDIRECTORY` as well (e.g. when SCLS_CONFIG_SUBDIRECTORY = `vim`, SCLS will perform it's lookups in `~/.config/vim` instead)

Currently, it supports our own `toml` format and vscode `json` (a basic effort).

Filename used as snippet scope ([language id][1]), filename `snippets.(toml|json)` will not attach scope to snippets.

For example, snippets with the filename `python.toml` or `python.json` would have a `python` scope.

Snippets format

```toml
[[snippets]]
prefix = "ld"
scope = [ "python" ]  # language id https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/identifiers#_known-language-identifiers
body = 'log.debug("$1")'
description = "log at debug level"
```

### Use external snippets collections from git repos

Configure sources in `~/.config/helix/external-snippets.toml` (or via env `EXTERNAL_SNIPPETS_CONFIG`)

```toml
[[sources]] # list of sources to load
name = "friendly-snippets"  # optional name shown on snippet description
git = "https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets.git" # git repo with snippets collections

[[sources.paths]] # list of paths to load on current source
scope = ["python"]  # optional scopes (language id) for current snippets
path = "snippets/python/python.json"  # where snippet file or dir located in repo
```


Clone or update snippets source repos to `~/.config/helix/external-snippets/<repo path>`

```console
$ simple-completion-language-server fetch-external-snippets
```


Validate snippets

```console
$ simple-completion-language-server validate-snippets
```

### Unicode input

Read unicode input config as each file from dir `~/.config/helix/unicode-input` (or specify path via `UNICODE_INPUT_PATH` env).

Unicode input format (toml key-value), for example `~/.config/helix/unicode-input/base.toml`

```toml
alpha = "Î±"
betta = "Î²"
gamma = "Î³"
fire = "ðŸ”¥"
```


Validate unicode input config

```console
$ simple-completion-language-server validate-unicode-input
```

### Citation completion

Citation keys completion from bibliography file declared in current document.
When completion is triggered with a prefixed `@` (which can be configured via `citation_prefix_trigger` settings), scls will try to extract the bibliography file path from the current document (regex can be configured via the `citation_bibfile_extract_regexp` setting) to parse and use it as a completion source.

To enable this feature, scls must be compiled with the `--features citation` flag.Â 

```console
$ cargo install --features citation --git https://github.com/estin/simple-completion-language-server.git
```

And initialize scls with `feature_citations = true`.

```toml
[language-server.scls.config]
max_completion_items = 20
feature_citations = true
```
